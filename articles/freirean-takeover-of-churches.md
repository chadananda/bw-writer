# The Freirean Takeover of Churches in America: Critical Pedagogy and Progressive Theology

## Introduction

Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy has profoundly influenced educational theory and practice worldwide since the publication of his seminal work, *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* (1970). While Freire's impact on secular education is well-documented, his influence on American religious institutions—particularly progressive Christian denominations—represents a significant yet under-examined cultural shift. This article explores how Freirean principles have been adopted, adapted, and implemented within American churches, transforming traditional religious education and pastoral approaches into vehicles for social justice and community empowerment.[^1]

The integration of Freirean pedagogy into American churches did not occur in isolation but emerged from the broader liberation theology movement that gained momentum in the 1970s and 1980s. As Freire's ideas about conscientization, dialogue, and praxis found resonance with progressive religious leaders seeking to address systemic injustice, a distinct approach to ministry began to take shape—one that challenged hierarchical church structures and emphasized the role of religious communities in social transformation.[^2]

## Historical Context: Freire and Liberation Theology

Paulo Freire (1921-1997), a Brazilian educator and philosopher, developed his critical pedagogy in response to the oppressive conditions he witnessed in his home country. Central to Freire's approach was the rejection of the "banking model" of education, wherein teachers deposit knowledge into passive students. Instead, he advocated for problem-posing education that empowers learners to critically analyze their social reality and work toward transformation.[^3]

Liberation theology, which emerged in Latin America during the same period, shared Freire's concern for the marginalized and oppressed. Theologians like Gustavo Gutiérrez, Leonardo Boff, and Jon Sobrino reinterpreted Christian teachings through the lens of social justice, arguing that the church must actively work to liberate people from poverty and oppression. The movement's emphasis on "preferential option for the poor" and its critique of unjust social structures aligned naturally with Freire's pedagogical approach.[^4]

The convergence of these two movements created fertile ground for the introduction of Freirean principles into American churches, particularly those already engaged with social justice issues. As Rebecca S. Chopp notes in her study of liberation theology in North America, "The reception of liberation theology coincided with growing dissatisfaction among progressive Christians regarding the church's complicity in systems of oppression."[^5]

## Pathways of Influence: How Freire Entered American Churches

### Theological Education

Theological seminaries served as primary conduits for Freirean thought into American churches. By the late 1970s, progressive seminaries began incorporating Freire's work into their curricula, particularly in courses on religious education, pastoral care, and social ethics. Union Theological Seminary, Episcopal Divinity School, and Pacific School of Religion were among the early adopters, training a generation of clergy who would later implement Freirean approaches in their congregations.[^6]

Dr. Mary Elizabeth Moore, a religious education scholar, observes that "Freire's emphasis on conscientization resonated with theological educators seeking to move beyond rote learning of doctrine toward critical engagement with scripture and tradition in light of contemporary social realities."[^7]

### Denominational Justice Initiatives

Mainline Protestant denominations, including the United Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church (USA), United Church of Christ, and Episcopal Church, established social justice offices and initiatives that drew heavily on Freirean methodology. These denominational programs provided resources, training, and support for congregations interested in addressing issues like racism, economic inequality, and environmental degradation through a Freirean lens.[^8]

The United Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society explicitly cited Freire in its justice education materials, encouraging congregations to engage in "critical reflection and action" on social issues. Similarly, the Presbyterian Hunger Program developed Freirean-inspired resources for congregational study and action on food justice issues.[^9]

### Community Organizing Connections

The relationship between faith communities and community organizing networks facilitated another pathway for Freirean influence. Organizations like the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF), PICO National Network (now Faith in Action), and Gamaliel Foundation worked closely with religious congregations, employing methods that drew from both Freirean pedagogy and religious traditions.[^10]

These organizing networks trained church leaders in Freirean-inspired approaches to community analysis, leadership development, and collective action. As congregations participated in organizing campaigns around housing, healthcare, immigration, and other issues, they incorporated Freirean principles into their understanding of ministry and mission.[^11]

## Freirean Praxis in Church Settings

### Transforming Religious Education

Traditional Sunday School models have been reimagined in many progressive congregations through a Freirean lens. Rather than transmitting fixed doctrinal content, these educational programs emphasize critical engagement with religious texts, connecting scripture to contemporary social issues, and encouraging participants to reflect on their own experiences in dialogue with tradition.[^12]

First Congregational United Church of Christ in Portland, Oregon, for example, developed an adult education program called "Faith and Justice Dialogues" that explicitly draws on Freire's problem-posing methodology. Participants examine biblical texts alongside contemporary social analysis, asking how religious teachings might inform responses to issues like homelessness, climate change, and racial injustice.[^13]

### Liturgical Innovations

Freirean influence extends to worship practices in some congregations, where traditional liturgies have been adapted to encourage greater participation and critical reflection. These innovations include:

- Dialogical sermons that invite congregation members to respond to and engage with the preacher
- Communal biblical interpretation where multiple voices contribute to understanding scripture
- Testimony sharing that validates lived experience as a source of theological insight
- Ritual actions that connect worship to social justice commitments[^14]

Reverend Dr. Andrea Ayvazian, founder of Sanctuary United Church of Christ in Northampton, Massachusetts, describes her congregation's approach: "We don't just talk about justice in our worship—we practice it through how we worship. Everyone's voice matters, everyone's experience contributes to our collective understanding of God's call."[^15]

### Community Engagement and Social Action

Perhaps the most visible manifestation of Freirean influence is in how churches engage with their broader communities. Congregations shaped by Freire's pedagogy tend to approach community work not as charity but as solidarity, working alongside community members rather than providing services for them.[^16]

Trinity Episcopal Church in Boston's Copley Square transformed its outreach to unhoused people by adopting a Freirean approach. Rather than simply providing meals and shelter, the church established a "Common Cathedral" program where unhoused individuals participate in leadership, decision-making, and ministry alongside housed congregants. This approach recognizes the knowledge and agency of those experiencing homelessness, challenging the traditional helper/helped dichotomy.[^17]

## Theological Implications

The integration of Freirean pedagogy into church settings has significant theological implications, prompting reconsiderations of traditional understandings of:

### Authority and Knowledge

Freirean approaches challenge hierarchical models of religious authority, suggesting that theological knowledge emerges not just from clergy or academic theologians but from the lived experiences of all believers, particularly those on the margins. This shift aligns with Protestant notions of "priesthood of all believers" but extends them in more radical directions.[^18]

### Salvation and Liberation

Churches influenced by Freire often emphasize salvation as both personal and social transformation, rejecting individualistic understandings focused solely on the afterlife. Liberation becomes a central theological category, with sin understood in terms of participation in oppressive systems rather than merely personal moral failings.[^19]

### Mission and Evangelism

The church's mission is reframed from converting individuals to transforming unjust social structures. Evangelism becomes sharing the "good news" of liberation rather than proselytizing. As one United Church of Christ pastor puts it, "We spread the gospel by participating in God's work of justice and healing in the world."[^20]

## Case Studies: Freirean Influence in Specific Congregations

### All Saints Episcopal Church, Pasadena, California

Under the leadership of Rector Ed Bacon (1995-2016), All Saints became known for its justice-oriented ministry grounded in Freirean principles. The congregation established "Learning Communities" that combined biblical study, social analysis, and action. These groups addressed issues ranging from economic inequality to LGBTQ+ rights, using Freire's cycle of reflection and action.[^21]

The church's "Young Adult Vocation Program" explicitly incorporated Freirean methodology, guiding participants through a process of examining their social location, privilege, and potential roles in social transformation. Program director Juliana Serrano noted that "Freire helps us understand that vocation isn't just about individual calling but about collective liberation."[^22]

### Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, San Francisco, California

Under the leadership of Reverend Cecil Williams, Glide developed a ministry model deeply influenced by Freirean principles. The congregation's "Facts on Crack" program in the 1980s exemplified this approach, bringing together community members, health professionals, and people with addiction experiences to develop collective responses to the crack cocaine epidemic.[^23]

Williams describes Glide's approach as "liberation ministry," noting that "we don't do things for people; we create spaces where people can discover their own power and use it for personal and community transformation."[^24]

### Sojourners Community, Washington, D.C.

Founded by Jim Wallis and other progressive evangelicals, Sojourners combines Freirean pedagogy with evangelical faith. The community's "Faith in Action" training programs teach congregational leaders how to analyze power structures in their communities and develop action strategies grounded in both biblical teaching and Freirean methodology.[^25]

Lisa Sharon Harper, former chief church engagement officer for Sojourners, explains: "We help Christians understand that the gospel is inherently political—not partisan, but concerned with how power works in communities. Freire gives us tools to engage that reality faithfully."[^26]

## Critiques and Limitations

The Freirean influence in American churches has not gone unchallenged. Critics from various theological perspectives have raised concerns about:

### Theological Reductionism

Some critics argue that Freirean approaches reduce Christian theology to social ethics, diminishing traditional doctrinal concerns and spiritual practices. Conservative theologian Carl F.H. Henry warned that liberation-oriented theologies risk "exchanging the transcendent God of biblical revelation for an immanent deity identified with historical processes."[^27]

### Political Partisanship

Others contend that churches influenced by Freire tend to align with progressive political positions, potentially alienating congregants with different political views. This critique suggests that Freirean approaches may undermine the church's ability to transcend partisan divisions.[^28]

### Cultural Appropriation

Some scholars question whether predominantly white, middle-class American congregations can authentically implement a pedagogy developed in the context of Brazilian poverty and oppression. Miguel De La Torre argues that "too often, liberation theology becomes an intellectual exercise for the privileged rather than a lived reality."[^29]

## Conclusion

The Freirean takeover of American churches represents a significant development in contemporary religious life, one that has transformed how many congregations understand their mission and practice. By integrating critical pedagogy with progressive theology, these churches have developed approaches to religious education, worship, and community engagement that emphasize dialogue, critical consciousness, and social transformation.

As American society continues to grapple with profound challenges—from persistent racial injustice to growing economic inequality and environmental crisis—churches influenced by Freire offer distinctive resources for faith-based responses. Their emphasis on connecting personal faith with structural analysis and collective action provides a counter-witness to both individualistic spirituality and disengaged institutionalism.

The future of this movement remains open. As younger generations increasingly demand that religious institutions address social justice concerns, Freirean approaches may find new resonance. At the same time, declining church attendance and polarized political discourse present challenges to congregations seeking to implement Freire's vision of dialogical community.

What remains clear is that Paulo Freire—an educator who never explicitly focused on religious institutions—has profoundly shaped how many American Christians understand the relationship between faith, education, and social change. His legacy lives on in congregations committed to what one pastor describes as "a gospel that doesn't just comfort the afflicted but challenges the comfortable to join in God's liberating work in the world."[^30]
